# Home Christmas Lighting Project

A comprehensive implementation guide for a scalable, year-round addressable LED lighting system using Falcon PiCap, Raspberry Pi, and Home Assistant integration.

## 🎄 Project Overview

This repository documents the complete setup of a home Christmas/holiday lighting system featuring:

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4 with Falcon PiCap controller
- **LEDs**: 12V WS2811 addressable pixels (scalable to 3000+ pixels)
- **Software**: Falcon Player (FPP) for show management, xLights for sequencing
- **Integration**: Home Assistant via MQTT for smart home control
- **Use Cases**: Daily ambient lighting, holiday displays, synchronized music shows

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
[Home Assistant] ←MQTT→ [Raspberry Pi + Falcon PiCap] → [12V WS2811 LED Pixels]
     (Control)                  (Controller)                    (Lights)
```

**Key Components**:
- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) running Falcon Player (FPP)
- Falcon PiCap HAT (2-4 outputs, 800 pixels each)
- 12V WS2811 addressable LED pixels (300-1500+ pixels)
- Mean Well LRS-350-12 power supply (350W)
- Home Assistant with MQTT broker integration

## 📦 Current Status

**Phase**: Planning & Documentation (as of 2025-12-24)

- ✅ Master plan created
- ✅ Complete documentation structure established
- ✅ Shopping list with supplier links
- ✅ Decision framework documented
- ✅ Architecture diagrams prompts prepared
- ⏳ Hardware procurement (next phase)

See [master_plan.md](master_plan.md) for detailed phase breakdown and timeline.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Controller**: Raspberry Pi 4 + Falcon PiCap
- **Software**: Falcon Player (FPP) v7.x+
- **Sequencing**: xLights
- **Integration**: Home Assistant + MQTT (Mosquitto)
- **LEDs**: 12V WS2811 addressable pixels
- **Network**: Wired Ethernet

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Daily Use**: Simple color control via Home Assistant for year-round lighting
2. **Holiday Shows**: Synchronized music and animation sequences for Christmas, Halloween, etc.
3. **Smart Home**: Full integration with Home Assistant automations and voice control
4. **Scalability**: Foundation to expand from 500 to 3000+ pixels without architecture changes
5. **Reliability**: Wired, weatherproof outdoor installation with minimal maintenance

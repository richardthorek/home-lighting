Upgrading to Addressable LED House Lighting – Controllers, Standards & Complete Setup Guide

Upgrading your house lighting with addressable RGB LEDs will let you create dynamic year-round lighting for events and go all-out at Christmas. We’ll break down two proven setup options – an entry-level DIY Wi-Fi controller and a more scalable Falcon controller – and explain everything you need end-to-end: controllers, lights, power supplies, connectors, mounting, and integration with Home Assistant. We’ll also demystify key terms and standards (like WS2811 vs WS2812, power injection, etc.) so you can make an informed decision. The most important information and recommendations are presented first, with detailed explanations and comparisons following.



Option 1: Entry-Level DIY – ESP32 Controller with WLED

Overview: The entry-level solution uses a small Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller (ESP32 or ESP8266) running the open-source WLED firmware to drive your addressable LED strips. This approach is budget-friendly and straightforward for a beginner, while still allowing advanced effects. It’s perfect for a few LED strips on your house (e.g. 2–3 strips of 5–10 m) and integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant for daily use7. You can always add more of these controllers if you expand later. Here’s what you’ll need and how it works:

Key Components (Option 1):

WLED Controller Hardware: An ESP32-based controller board with WLED. You can use a DIY module (like a NodeMCU/ESP32 DevKit board) or a pre-made WLED controller for convenience7. A highly regarded option is the QuinLED-DigUno (or DigQuad for more outputs) – an open-source ESP32 controller board designed for addressable LEDs2. It comes with level shifters, fuses, and an onboard regulator, and typically ships with WLED installed, so no coding needed2. Other brands like GLEDOPTO offer ready-to-go WLED controllers as well7. One controller can run multiple strips in tandem (the DigUno handles ~300 5V LEDs or 600 12V LEDs on its single output at full power draw, more if you use power limit features2). For your case (2–3 strips of ~10 m), you might use one controller per long strip for simplicity, or a DigQuad to drive up to 4 runs from one unit. Each controller will connect to your Wi-Fi network.
Addressable LED Strips/Strings: You’ll need the LEDs themselves. For this option, many DIYers use WS2812B LED strips (5 V strips with individually addressable LEDs)1 or WS2811/WS2815 strips (12 V versions, explained below). These come in reels (typically 5 m each) which you can join to make 10 m runs. Make sure to get weatherproof strips (rated IP65 or IP67) for outdoor use – e.g. strips encased in silicone. Alternatively, you can use pixel strings (also called bullet nodes) which are individual sealed LED nodes on wiring – a popular choice for rooflines. For instance, Ray Wu’s store offers 12 V WS2811 bullet pixels with 3-pin waterproof connectors. Strips vs strings: Both will work; it’s mostly aesthetic and practical preference. Strips can give a continuous light line and can be hidden in aluminum channels with diffusers for a clean look2. Pixel strings are slightly easier to repair (replace one node if it fails) and can be mounted with clips or plastic tracks (e.g. drilled PVC or specialized mounting strips)2. Many permanent installs actually use pixel nodes for outlines and strips for areas where a linear look is needed2. If unsure, you could start with one type and see how it looks.
Power Supply: Addressable LEDs are power-hungry, so a quality DC power supply is critical. Choose a supply voltage matching your LEDs (5 V for WS2812B strips, or 12 V for WS2811 strips/nodes). You’ll want a DC switching power supply with enough current capacity and some overhead. As a rule of thumb, budget 0.05 A per LED at 5 V, or 0.03 A per LED at 12 V2. In practical terms, 300 LEDs (5 m of 60 LED/m strip) can draw up to ~15 A at 5 V (75 W) if on full white; 600 LEDs (~10 m) ~30 A (150 W). A common choice is a 5 V 60 A (300 W) supply for a couple of 5 m strips, or a 12 V 30 A (360 W) supply for similar lengths2. You likely won’t run all LEDs at 100% white all the time, but the supply should handle peak demand without overheating. Popular brands are Mean Well (known for reliability)3, but there are cheaper units too (many hobbyists use generic 360 W units successfully2). Make sure the supply is UL-listed if possible, and keep it dry (mount it indoors or in an outdoor-rated enclosure).
Connectors and Wiring: To hook everything up, you’ll need 3-core wiring and waterproof connectors. Since you mentioned Ray Wu lights, you can use “Ray Wu” 3-pin pigtail connectors for consistency – these are the standard waterproof plugs that Ray Wu’s pixels use. Get a few extra male/female pairs for making extensions and for connecting to your controller leads. You’ll also want some 18 AWG 3-core cable (or 16 AWG for longer runs) to run power and data from the supply/controller to the strips2. Many pre-made pixel strings come with pigtails attached; for strips, you might need to solder on pigtails or use solderless clip connectors (ensure they’re weatherproof). Power injection wiring is important for longer runs: Because voltage drops over distance, you should feed power at multiple points on a long strip. The general guideline is to inject power at both ends of each 5 m (for 5 V strips), and at least at the ends of each 10 m (for 12 V strips)2. That means for a 10 m run of 5 V LEDs, you’d connect the 5 V/GND from the power supply to both the start and the midpoint/end of the strip. For 12 V, feeding at the start and end of the 10 m is usually enough2. Plan to run additional 2-wire cables for these injection points (they can share ground with the main line). Using “home-run” injections (separate wires back to the power supply for each injection point) gives the best results2. Your WLED controller and power supply will share a common ground with the LEDs (always connect all grounds together).
Mounting Hardware: Mounting will depend on strip vs string. For LED strips along eaves or edges, a neat solution is to use aluminum LED channels (tracks) with diffusive covers which both protect the strip and give a professional look2. These channels can be cut to length and screwed under soffits or along trim. If that’s not available, you can also use clear silicone mounting clips that hold the strip in place every few feet. For pixel node strings, common methods include using plastic pixel mounting strips (long strips with holes that you pop the nodes into, e.g. from Boscoyo or similar), or repurposing vinyl J-channel (siding trim) with holes drilled for the pixels2. These can be attached under your roofline or on surfaces to form straight lines of lights. Ensure the LEDs themselves are rated for outdoor use (IP67 nodes or silicone-coated strips) and avoid placing them in direct water submersion. Lastly, consider a weatherproof enclosure for the controller and power supply. A plastic junction box or outdoor-grade case can house the ESP32 controller (if it’s not already in a case) and a small power supply. Many holiday-light enthusiasts use enclosures like the CG-1500 or TA-200 boxes to hold controllers and wiring outdoors. For an entry setup, you might keep the power supply indoors (if the run to lights is short) and just route the low-voltage cables outside.
Setup & Integration (Option 1): Once hardware is installed, the WLED software takes over. WLED is a feature-rich firmware that you configure via a web browser or mobile app. You’ll connect the ESP32 to your home Wi-Fi and use WLED’s interface to set up the LED type (e.g. WS2812B) and the length (number of LEDs). WLED provides dozens of fancy lighting effects and animations out of the box, plus the ability to set static colors or custom sequences. You can create presets and playlists in WLED for different scenes (e.g. a patriotic theme, Halloween colors, Christmas chase patterns, etc.) and have Home Assistant activate them. Home Assistant integration is very easy – it has a native WLED integration that will auto-discover the controller on your network and show it as a light entity (or multiple if you use segments)6. You’ll then be able to turn it on/off, set colors, and even trigger WLED’s built-in effects from Home Assistant. Each LED strip can be treated as an addressable light; if you define segments in WLED (splitting one strip into sections), Home Assistant will treat each segment as a separate light entity6. This means you can have, say, the upper and lower eaves controlled independently if they’re on the same strip. WLED’s integration exposes effect selection, brightness, and even sensors like the controller’s Wi-Fi signal and LED current estimate to Home Assistant6.

Usage: For everyday use, you might simply turn on the lights to a single color or a subtle effect via Home Assistant automations (for example, schedule a soft white glow in the evenings, or orange on Halloween). WLED supports solid colors and basic effects through the standard HA light controls (the integration maps WLED effects to effect names in Home Assistant)6. You can also use WLED’s app for on-the-fly changes; it has a phone-friendly interface with color pickers and effect menus. Notably, WLED allows grouping multiple controllers—if you get more than one, you can sync them so they play the same pattern in unison (either via Wi-Fi sync or by having one act as primary)5. WLED devices can also receive E1.31 or DDP network data, which means in the future you could drive them from xLights or FPP if you ever run a coordinated show5. This bridges nicely into bigger holiday setups. In fact, many in the community use a mix of WLED controllers for individual props/strips and then use something like Falcon Player (FPP) to send synchronized data to them for a Christmas show5. For now, you can enjoy the “absurd amount of effects, palettes, timers and presets” that WLED offers, all locally controlled with no cloud required7.

Pros & Cons (Option 1): The WLED approach is low-cost, wireless, and flexible. An ESP32 controller might cost only $10–$20 (a QuinLED-DigUno kit is around $30–$40), and the rest of the expense is just the LEDs and power supply. You’re not locked into one vendor’s ecosystem – WLED supports essentially all the popular addressable LED types (WS2811, WS2812B, SK6812, APA102, etc.)6, so it’s future-proof if you add different LEDs. Integration with smart home systems is straightforward and there’s a large community for support. You also have the convenience of Wi-Fi control (no running long data cables from a central box – just needs a good Wi-Fi signal at the controller). On the downside, Wi-Fi based control can be slightly less reliable in very noisy networks or for extremely time-critical sync (though for basic scenes you won’t notice any issues). If your outdoors Wi-Fi is solid (sounds like you have coverage outside), WLED will work great. Another consideration is that each WLED controller is a separate device – controlling 2–3 of them together is easy to sync, but if in the future you had 10–15 controllers it can become a bit more management (tools exist for that, though). In contrast, a centralized controller can output to many strings without separate Wi-Fi modules (as we’ll see in Option 2). However, many users simply add a few WLED nodes as needed, and it scales fine for moderate setups. The wiring for Option 1 is also a bit more distributed – you’ll power each controller locally – but this actually can reduce long power runs. In summary, Option 1 (WLED on ESP32) is an excellent starter solution: it’s affordable, has full Home Assistant compatibility, and is “community-tested” – WLED is a very mature project with a strong user base in the smart lighting community7.

Option 2: Scalable Solution – Falcon Controller + Raspberry Pi (FPP)

Overview: The scalable option uses dedicated Falcon pixel controller hardware and a Raspberry Pi running Falcon Player (FPP) to control the LEDs. Falcon controllers are a gold-standard in the holiday lighting hobby – they are designed to drive large numbers of pixels with high reliability. This setup is well-suited if you plan to expand your display significantly (more lights, more complex synchronized shows) or prefer a wired Ethernet-based system. It does come at higher cost and complexity, but provides robust central control for thousands of LEDs8. For the current scope (2–3 strips), a Falcon-based setup is somewhat “overkill,” but it lays a foundation for future expansion and can certainly be used for day-to-day ambient lighting too. We’ll focus on two hardware variants: the Falcon PiCap (an add-on for Raspberry Pi) and the Falcon F16v4 (a standalone 16-port controller). Both are made by PixelController (Falcon) and supported by the FPP software.

Key Components (Option 2):

Falcon Controller Hardware: You have a couple of choices here:
Falcon PiCap: This is a Raspberry Pi HAT – a board that plugs onto a Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins and turns it into a pixel controller. The Falcon PiCap v2 (~$50 USD) provides 2 dedicated pixel outputs (plus 2 expansion outputs) that each can run 800+ pixels (WS2811/WS2812), all with proper buffering and fusing on board8. It also includes a DMX output if you ever need to control DMX fixtures. The PiCap supports input voltage of 5–13 V, so you can power it with the same 5 V or 12 V supply used for your LEDs and it will feed the Pi as well8. Essentially, a Pi + PiCap becomes a compact 2-output controller. (It actually has a total of 4 outputs listed, but typically 2 are useable for WS281x LEDs and the others can be for differential receivers or certain use cases – for simplicity plan for 2 outputs for pixels). This is perfect for your scenario (you could put one strip on Output1, another on Output2, etc.).
Falcon F16v4: This is a standalone 16-output pixel controller board (does not require a Pi for basic operation). The F16v4 (current model as of 2025) can receive pixel data over Ethernet (E1.31 sACN or Art-Net protocols) and drive up to 16 strings natively – and even up to 48 strings with add-on expansion boards4. Each output supports around 1024 pixels in 16-port mode (or ~700 pixels if using all 48 outputs)4, which is extremely high capacity. In total the F16v4 can handle up to 96,304 channels (~32k RGB pixels) as input4 by accepting 192 universes of E1.31/Art-Net data. The board has built-in fuse protection for each output and a web interface for configuration. It even has an on-board Wi-Fi module (ESP-07) that can be used for wireless control or as an FPP Remote4. This is a very powerful controller – probably beyond what you need initially, but I mention it as the “Falcon board” you were considering. Cost is around $240 USD for the board. Falcon also makes smaller versions (there was an F4, which had 4 outputs, but the PiCap more or less fills that niche now). There are also other manufacturers (e.g. Kulp Lights controllers or Hanson Electronics in Australia) that make Pi and BeagleBone based controllers with various output counts, often running the same FPP software. For example, the Hanson rPi-28D+ is a Pi HAT similar to the Falcon PiCap (2 outputs) available in Australia. These alternatives might save cost or shipping if needed, but the Falcon lineup is very well documented and supported.
Falcon Player (FPP) Software: If you use the PiCap, you will need to run Falcon Player (FPP) on the Raspberry Pi. FPP is a purpose-built, open-source software that turns a Pi (or BeagleBone, etc.) into a show controller. Think of FPP as the “brains” – it can play lighting sequences, synchronize multiple controllers, and bridge between Home Assistant and the Falcon hardware. You install FPP on the Pi (usually via a bootable image on an SD card). In your setup, FPP will output the pixel data to the PiCap’s ports directly (so the Pi + PiCap is an all-in-one controller running FPP). If you use a standalone Falcon F16 controller, you can still use a Pi with FPP as the master scheduler or you can have the F16 itself run in “remote” mode with sequences on an SD card4. Typically, even with an F16, people use a Pi as the central FPP master and set the Falcon board as a subordinate. For simplicity: plan to use a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 with FPP in either case. FPP has a web UI you access to configure things like pixel output settings (e.g. set Output1 to WS2811 with 500 pixels, etc.), upload sequences, and install plugins. It supports a huge range of pixel protocols (WS2811/2812, WS2815, APA102, SK6812, and many more) – basically anything you throw at the Falcon hardware, FPP can drive it9. It also can input or output E1.31 (sACN), Art-Net, and DDP data, making it very flexible4. One powerful feature is FPP’s scheduling and playlist capability – you can script your Pi to play certain lighting sequences or effects at certain times (e.g. automatically turn on a “rainbow chase” effect every evening at dusk, or run a full music-synchronized show at 7 PM on Christmas Eve).
LEDs and Power: The LEDs and power requirements in Option 2 are essentially the same as Option 1, with one difference: if you foresee very large expansions, you’ll likely stick with 12 V pixels (WS2811 or WS2815) for efficiency. Falcon controllers can output to either 5 V or 12 V pixels (they simply pass through whatever supply voltage you provide – you can even feed both 5 V and 12 V on different power banks of the board if needed)4. For 10 m outdoor runs, 12 V pixels are advantageous because you can run 10 m with a single injection at each end (as noted)2, whereas 5 V would need mid-point injections. Many community “mega displays” use 12 V WS2811 nodes for rooflines and outlines due to their long-run friendliness1. You can absolutely use Ray Wu’s 12 V WS2811 bullet strings here – e.g. strings of 50 or 100 pixels with 3″ (10 cm) spacing, IP67–68 rated. These often come with Ray Wu 3-pin pigtails pre-attached, which will match the pigtails you use on the Falcon outputs. If you prefer strips, you could use 12 V WS2815 strips (which allow individual LED control at 12 V and have a backup data line)2 – they are more expensive, but combine the benefit of 12 V (less voltage drop) with pixel-level control like WS2812B. Alternatively, 12 V WS2811 strips (which group LEDs in 3s) are cheaper; many people find the grouping acceptable for accent lighting1. Since the Falcon can handle either, it’s up to you – just configure the correct chipset in FPP. Power supplies: You will need one or more robust DC power supplies just like in Option 1. The PiCap itself can be powered from the pixel power input (so if you feed 12 V into the PiCap, it will have a regulator for the Pi; if you feed 5 V, it will pass that to the Pi). The F16 board typically has two power input terminals (each feeding 8 outputs) and supports 5–13 V input4. For a modest setup, you might only need a single 12 V 350 W supply to start. For larger expansions, you might use multiple supplies dividing the load (the Falcon board has separate power zones to accommodate this)4. The general current calculations remain the same (e.g. ~0.03 A per pixel at 12 V). It’s not uncommon for big displays to use several 350 W or even larger server-style PSUs to feed power distribution boards. In your case, one quality 12 V supply will do. Just remember to fuse your outputs – the Falcon boards have built-in fuses on each output (the F16 has 16 mini blade fuses, one per output)4. The PiCap v2 also has fuses on its outputs8. Ensure the fuse rating is appropriate for the number of pixels on that output (e.g. 5 A or 7.5 A fuse for a few hundred pixels). This protects your wiring from short-circuits. As with Option 1, plan for power injection on long runs (the Falcon doesn’t magically eliminate voltage drop – you still inject at far ends), but you can run extra power wires from the same supply or use the Falcon’s multiple outputs to connect mid-points.
Connectivity: The Falcon Pi/PiCap will be on Ethernet via the Raspberry Pi (or Wi-Fi if you absolutely must, but Ethernet is preferred for reliability). The Falcon F16 has an Ethernet jack (and a 2-port switch so you can daisy-chain controllers)4. Typically, you’d wire the controller to your network router or a local switch. Home Assistant will communicate to FPP or the Falcon over the network. Falcon controllers listen for industry-standard lighting protocols: E1.31 (sACN) or Art-Net. These are basically ways to send RGB data over IP networks. FPP can act as the bridge – e.g. Home Assistant could send an MQTT or API command to FPP, and FPP sets the lights. However, an exciting development is the Home Assistant MQTT Discovery plugin for FPP5. Using this, FPP can publish each defined model or output as a light that Home Assistant directly knows about. In practice: you set up “overlay models” in FPP corresponding to your LED segments (say a model for “House Outline”) and the plugin makes them appear in HA as light entities5. Then you can turn them on/off or set solid colors via HA with no extra coding. FPP will in turn drive the Falcon outputs. This plugin essentially gives you similar everyday control as WLED, but through the Falcon system. It’s implemented via MQTT under the hood (FPP acts as an MQTT client that HA discovers). The forum confirms this works well – you can have HA set colors on FPP-controlled lights easily5. So for daily scenes, you would use that integration to treat your Falcon-controlled pixels like smart lights.
Setup & Integration (Option 2): First, you’d assemble the hardware: mount the PiCap on the Pi (if using PiCap) or set up the F16 in an enclosure. Connect your LED strips or pixel strings to the controller’s outputs (each output has a Data, Ground, and Power terminal – you’ll attach a pigtail connector matching your lights). Connect the power supply to the controller’s power input terminals, and ensure proper grounding (all grounds common). After hardware is wired, install Falcon Player (FPP) on the Pi (not needed if you only use an F16 standalone, but recommended). On first boot, you’d use a web browser to access FPP’s interface (the Pi will get an IP on your network). In FPP’s Channel Outputs setup, you’ll define the controller outputs – e.g. Output1 on PiCap: WS2811, start channel 1, length 300 pixels; Output2: WS2811, start channel 901, length 300 pixels (just as an example addressing scheme). If using an F16 via E1.31, you’d instead configure FPP to send E1.31 data out over Ethernet to the F16 (or you can configure the F16 as a remote). FPP and the Falcon hardware have a bit of a learning curve, but there are good manuals and a community. The Falcon Player Manual and forums cover configuring outputs and testing5. You can test output from FPP (there’s a Display Testing page to turn on all LEDs or chase patterns for verification).

For Home Assistant, install the FPP HA Integration (MQTT). In FPP’s UI, you’d go to Plugins and enable the Home Assistant MQTT plugin, selecting which models (outputs) to expose5. In Home Assistant, after configuring MQTT, you should see new light entities corresponding to those FPP models, each controllable as an RGB light. Once this link is set, you can do basic on/off, color, and brightness control from HA for each segment just like any smart bulb5. For example, you might have “FrontRoofLights” entity that you can turn on and set to blue from HA – behind the scenes, HA sends an MQTT message, FPP updates that model’s color, and the Falcon controller outputs the data to the LEDs. This makes daily automation straightforward.

Where Option 2 really shines is running complex shows when you “ramp up at Christmas.” If you want synchronized music and animated patterns, you will use a sequencing software like xLights (free) to create a show. You’d lay out your house model in xLights and design effects on the timeline with music. Then you export the sequence and load it into FPP. FPP (on the Pi) can then play that sequence, sending synchronized data to the Falcon controller outputs. The FalconPiCap or F16 will faithfully output the patterns to each LED at precise timing. This setup is what many holiday light enthusiasts use: xLights for sequencing, FPP for scheduling/playback, Falcon hardware for output. It’s very robust – you can schedule nightly shows or trigger them on demand. To give context, Falcon Pi Player (FPP) was designed for exactly this purpose: to control addressable LED displays (WS2811, WS2812B, etc.) in sync with music and automation9. It runs on the Pi and takes the sequences from xLights (or other software) and “plays them back” on your physical lights9. FPP can handle real-time syncing, large channel counts, and has a web interface for status9. The Falcon controllers themselves are built to receive the streaming data (E1.31/Art-Net), and newer models like the F16v4 even allow storing sequences on an SD card on the controller as a backup or remote mode4. For special events (like a birthday or Diwali or Christmas), you could have pre-made sequences that FPP runs, while for everyday use you stick to simple HA control.

Pros & Cons (Option 2): The Falcon-based solution is extremely powerful and scalable. It’s what you’d ultimately need if you expand to many more LEDs or want perfectly synchronized animations and music shows. Advantages include: wired reliability (using Ethernet/MQTT means no hiccups or latency issues; your Pi and Falcon board sit on a stable network), high output capacity (you can add more lights without adding more controllers – e.g. just move from a PiCap to a bigger Falcon or add expansion boards), and a rich feature set (temperature sensors, voltage monitoring on the controller, etc., as seen in Falcon specs4). Falcon controllers also support additional protocols (like DMX or Renard outputs for other lighting gear)4, giving you integration with different systems if you ever need. With FPP, you get fine control: you can script sequences, trigger effects via MQTT or HTTP, and coordinate multiple controllers (for example, if in a few years you have multiple Falcon controllers or a mix of Falcon and WLED, FPP can control all in sync).

The trade-offs are cost and complexity. The PiCap approach is the least expensive entry to Falcon world, but still a Raspberry Pi (maybe $50) + PiCap ($50) + case, etc., so perhaps $100+ versus a $20 ESP32 option. A full Falcon F16 is a few hundred dollars once you include power supplies, case, etc. For just 2–3 strips, that’s a lot of investment if you’re not certain you’ll expand. Complexity-wise, setting up FPP and understanding universes/channels requires time – not that it’s rocket science, but it’s more involved than plugging in a WLED and clicking a few buttons. You mentioned not hesitating to spend a bit extra for scale, just not going very expensive at this stage. A good middle ground could be the Falcon PiCap + Pi, which gives you Falcon-quality output on a small scale and can later be extended. Another middle option: the Kulp K4-PB or K8-PB (BeagleBone controller boards) which are similar in price and offer 4–8 outputs – but again, similar complexity. The Hanson rPi-28D+ (AUS) is ~$38 AUD for 2 outputs on a Pi, which might be of interest given your location (it’s compatible with FPP). In any case, the Falcon route ties you into the xLights/FPP ecosystem for advanced usage – which is a positive if you want pro-level shows, but maybe overkill if you only ever do simple colors.

One way to utilize the best of both worlds: you could mix these approaches. For example, some users run WLED on small props and have a Falcon controller for large runs, all orchestrated together. In your specific plan, you might start with the PiCap (since you were considering it) and run your 2–3 strips through it. Then play around with FPP and Home Assistant integration. If you find it too complex for daily use, note that you can also run WLED on a Pi or use other firmware, but sticking with FPP is recommended for Falcon hardware. The good news is that with the Home Assistant MQTT plugin setup, your experience controlling Falcon/FPP lights in HA can be nearly as simple as WLED – just on a sturdier backbone5.

Below is a side-by-side comparison of the two options:

Aspect

Option 1: DIY WLED (ESP32)

Option 2: Falcon + FPP

Controller Hardware

ESP32-based board (e.g. QuinLED-DigUno, NodeMCU, Gledopto, etc.) running WLED firmware. Typically 1–2 LED outputs (more with add-ons) on a single controller2.

Falcon PiCap on Raspberry Pi (2–4 outputs)8, or Falcon F16v4 standalone (16 outputs expandable to 48)4. Dedicated microcontroller for pixel output; Pi runs FPP for brains.

Supported LED Types

Virtually all addressable LEDs: WS2812B, WS2811, SK6812, APA102, etc. WLED supports both 3-wire (NeoPixel) and 4-wire (SPI) LEDs6. You configure the type in software.

Virtually all addressable LEDs (WS2811, WS2812B, WS2815, SK6812, APA102, and 70+ others) supported by Falcon controllers4. Configure in FPP web UI or Falcon web UI.

Max Pixels per Output

Practical limit of a few hundred to a thousand LEDs per output on ESP32. (WLED can handle ~1000+ LEDs on one output, but Wi-Fi bandwidth and frame rate may limit very large counts.) E.g. a DigUno board can source ~300 5V pixels @100% power (15A) without injection, but WLED can drive more if power is injected and brightness is managed2.

High capacity: PiCap ~800 pixels per output8; Falcon F16v4 supports 1024 pixels per output in 16-port mode (and ~704 in 48-port mode)4. Total tens of thousands of pixels possible (limited by E1.31 universes). Designed for large-scale displays.

Data Communication

Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz). Controller connects to your LAN wirelessly. Some WLED controllers (e.g. Gledopto GL-C-616) even have Ethernet, but typically it’s Wi-Fi7. Slight latency (few milliseconds) but fine for home use.

Ethernet (wired LAN). Pi or Falcon board connects via RJ45. Uses streaming protocols (sACN E1.31, Art-Net, or Falcon’s sync) for data4. Very stable for high data rates. (Falcon F16v4 also has an on-board Wi-Fi AP if needed4, but wired is standard.)

Integration with Home Assistant

Native WLED Integration: Home Assistant auto-discovers WLED devices on the network6. Each segment shows up as a Light entity with effect support6. No additional broker needed. Control via HA or the WLED mobile/web app.

MQTT or API Integration: Use FPP’s Home Assistant MQTT Discovery plugin to expose Falcon-controlled lights as HA Light entities5. Requires an MQTT broker setup. Alternatively, control via HTTP requests to FPP’s API. More setup, but once configured, appears in HA similarly (RGB light).

Local Control & Effects

WLED has built-in effects, palettes, and schedules accessible via web/app or HA7. Great for instant gratification (e.g. “Rainbow” effect at a click). Can be voice-controlled via Alexa/Google (WLED supports that)5.

FPP can run scripts or preset sequences for effects. It’s oriented toward playing back prepared sequences (from xLights). You can create static color presets in FPP or trigger small scripts, but it’s less out-of-the-box fancy effects compared to WLED. Intended for precision control and pre-programmed shows.

Scalability

Add more controllers as needed – each ESP32 is inexpensive. WLED can sync multiple controllers for unified effects5. However, many separate devices might become a management overhead as system grows. Best for tens to a few hundreds of pixels per controller.

Highly scalable – one Falcon controller handles many outputs. To expand, you might add expansion boards or additional Falcon units (e.g. an F48 for distributed outputs). FPP can coordinate multiple controllers in sync flawlessly. Designed for hundreds of meters of lights.

Cost Estimate

Entry cost: Low. ESP32 board ~$10–$20, plus maybe $10 in wiring/connectors. WLED is free. For 2–3 strips (approx 1500 LEDs) you’d spend most on LEDs & power supplies (say $150–$300 depending on LED type and wattage). The control hardware portion is minimal – perhaps <10% of total.

Entry cost: Moderate to high. Raspberry Pi ~$50, PiCap ~$50; or Falcon F16 ~$240. Enclosures, etc. add maybe $50. Software (FPP, xLights) is free. Overall, controlling the same 1500 LEDs might involve $100–$400 in control hardware on top of LEDs & PSU. This investment is justified if you plan to scale up further or demand pro-grade synchronization.

Community & Support

Huge DIY community support (forums, Discord). WLED documentation is solid. Many Home Assistant users use WLED for holiday lights7. Tons of shared effects/presets out there.

Strong community in holiday lighting forums (Falcon Christmas forum, AusChristmasLighting, etc.). More niche than generic IoT, but very active knowledge base. Good official manuals for Falcon hardware and FPP.

Pros Summary

Easy and inexpensive. Simple setup, wireless control, rich effects library. Perfect for beginners and medium displays. Home Assistant integration is plug-and-play. Flexible placement (no long data cables). Scale by just adding nodes.

Extremely robust and expandable. Centralized control of many lights, wired reliability, pro-level synchronization (required for complex musical shows). Plenty of outputs and power management. Integration possible into HA (with some setup) so you don’t lose daily convenience.

Cons Summary

Wi-Fi dependence (must ensure good signal; slight chance of dropouts). Each controller has a limit, so multiple units might be needed for very large setups. Not as inherently synchronized for high-speed animations across multiple controllers (though linking features exist).

Higher cost upfront. Steeper learning curve (FPP, networking, sequencing). More wiring at the controller (home-run of all strips to central point). Overkill for small simple setups. Requires MQTT or similar for direct HA control of individual colors (a bit more complex to set up).

Addressable LED Standards & Terms Explained

Finally, let’s clarify some of the standards and terminology you’ll encounter in this project, so you know what everything means:

Addressable vs Non-Addressable LEDs: “Addressable” LEDs (also called digital or pixel LEDs) have an integrated driver chip that allows each LED or group of LEDs to be controlled independently via a data signal. This is in contrast to regular RGB LED strips (non-addressable) where the entire strip displays the same color (no individual control). In an addressable strip, you send data along a single wire and each LED’s chip picks out its instructions for brightness/color1. Common addressable LED chips include WS2811, WS2812B, WS2815, SK6812, APA102, etc. Non-addressable strips won’t do the cool chasing patterns – so you definitely want addressable for this project.
WS2811 vs WS2812B: These are two extremely popular LED driver ICs used in addressable LEDs. WS2812B is often known by Adafruit’s name “NeoPixel.” It is a 5 V chip built into each LED package, meaning every LED can be individually controlled1. WS2812B strips usually come as 5 V strips in 30, 60 or 144 LEDs per meter. WS2811, on the other hand, is a slightly older design where the driver chip is separate from the LEDs. WS2811 typically operates at 12 V and each WS2811 IC controls a group of 3 RGB LEDs together1. In practice, a 12 V WS2811 strip will have its LEDs in sets of three that always show the same color (because one chip drives that trio). This makes WS2811 strips a bit less granular in control (every 3 LEDs = 1 pixel output), but it greatly reduces the number of chips and wiring complexity for long runs. The key differences:
Voltage: WS2812B is 5 V; WS2811 is often 12 V1.
LED Control: WS2812B = individual LED; WS2811 = groups of three (on strips)1. (WS2811 is also used in pixel nodes, where usually each node is one WS2811 pixel driving 3 LEDs in that node. A typical 12 V pixel node string has 50 nodes, each node has one WS2811 chip and 3 LED diodes, and those 3 diodes act together as one pixel).
Wiring: Both use 3 wires (power, ground, data) and are controlled serially on one data line (no separate clock)1.
Power and Efficiency: 5 V WS2812B draws more current for the same length, whereas 12 V WS2811 draws less current but more voltage. Because WS2811 groups LEDs, the per-LED power consumption is lower for a large strip (e.g. ~14 W per meter for WS2811 vs 18 W per meter for WS2812B at full brightness)1. However, a single WS2811 pixel (3 LEDs white) and a single WS2812B pixel (1 LED white) both draw about 60 mA – the WS2811 is just lighting 3 diodes with that, WS2812B one diode1.
Use Cases: WS2811 (12 V) excels in long runs and outdoor installations where you want less frequent power injection and longer cable distances1. It’s very common in roofline lighting and large Christmas displays1. WS2812B (5 V) is common for precise lighting and high-density effects – e.g. indoor accent lighting, props, and situations where you have power available every meter or so1. Both types can be used for a house outline; many choose 12 V (WS2811) to simplify wiring, sacrificing some granularity that isn’t noticeable for distant viewing.
WS2813 and WS2815: These are variants that improved on the above chips. WS2813 is basically a WS2812B with a redundant data line – if one LED dies, the signal skips it, so the rest of the strip continues (fewer “single point failures”). It’s 5 V and individually addressable. WS2815 is a 12 V individually addressable LED – effectively a 12 V version of WS2813. WS2815 strips allow each LED to be controlled and also have dual-signal lines for reliability. They draw about 10 mA per color (30 mA per LED on white, as opposed to 15–20 mA in WS2812), so power consumption is a bit different, but the main advantage is 12 V with per-LED control. The downside is cost – WS2815 strips are more expensive than standard ones2. If budget permits, WS2815 can be a great choice for a permanent install (12 V convenience + no 3-LED grouping).
SK6812 and RGBW strips: The SK6812 is another 5 V addressable LED very similar to WS2812B, but it comes in RGBW variants – meaning besides red, green, blue, it has a fourth white LED (which can be warm white, cool white, etc.). If you want the ability to have a true white light (or pastel colors with white mixed in) for year-round use, an RGBW strip is worth considering. SK6812 in RGBW mode will draw more power and requires controllers to send 4 color channels per pixel (WLED and Falcon both support SK6812 RGBW)2. They also come in 5 V and some 12 V formats (12 V ones typically still group LEDs). The white LED helps if you want a nice warm white house light at times, rather than combining RGB (which can look cool-white or not perfectly white). It’s a bit more niche, but available.
Clocked vs Clockless LEDs: You might hear about APA102 (DotStar) LEDs – these use a 4-wire system (data and clock lines) which allows very high refresh rates and is not timing-sensitive to control. WS2811/2812 are clockless (one-wire) protocol, meaning the controller must send data at a specific timing. Virtually all modern microcontrollers and dedicated controllers handle the WS2811 protocol fine, so this isn’t a concern. APA102/SK9822 (clocked) LEDs are great for advanced projects (like LED displays) because you can push data faster, but they tend to be more expensive and are less common for long strips on houses (they are usually 5 V and used in projects like LED POV displays, etc.). Both WLED and Falcon controllers support these as well64, but unless you have a special need, you’ll likely stick with the more common clockless type for your home installation.
Power Injection: This term has come up repeatedly – it simply means feeding power at multiple points along your LED run. Because of voltage drop over the thin copper traces in strips or the thin wire in pixel strings, the voltage at the far end of a strip can sag (e.g. a 5 V strip might drop to 4 V or less by the end if only fed from one end, causing dimmer or off-color LEDs towards the far end). To solve this, you “inject” 5 V or 12 V and ground from the power supply at the far end and possibly middle of the strip as well, so that every section of the strip has a power feed. Think of it as making several shorter strips in parallel from a power perspective. A good practice is injection at least every 5 m for 5 V, and every 10 m for 12 V2 (more often if high LED density or if you run at full brightness frequently). Practically, you’ll run a two-conductor cable from your PSU to the strip’s midpoint or end, and connect 5 V to the strip’s + and ground to ground (do not connect data to these injection wires from the far end!). Always maintain correct polarity and join grounds. Using fused injections (fuse each feed) is wise for safety. Parallel injection refers to running a feed along the strip in parallel2 – some put a bus wire along the strip for reinforcement. Home-run injection means each injection point has its own wire back to the PSU terminals2 – this is electrically best. In your build, plan the injection wires so you don’t get voltage drop across the strips. For example, for a 10 m strip, feed at the start and end at minimum2. The Falcon or WLED controller will be at the start; you can use the same power supply’s output to run another cable to the end. This way, voltage at both ends is ~5 V (or 12 V), and the middle of the strip might drop a bit but stay within tolerance. Without injection, the far end might get noticeably dimmer or shift color (toward red) when showing white; with injection, you even out the voltage.
MQTT: Stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, a lightweight publish/subscribe protocol often used in Home Automation. In our context, the FPP Home Assistant plugin uses MQTT to announce lights to HA5. Home Assistant connects to an MQTT broker (server), and FPP and HA exchange messages through it. You don’t need to deeply understand it beyond configuring the broker (like Mosquitto) and enabling the plugin. Simply put, MQTT enables real-time messaging between HA and FPP. WLED doesn’t require MQTT because Home Assistant can talk to it directly via its API, but WLED also optionally supports MQTT for those who want it.
E1.31 (sACN) and Art-Net: These are network protocols for sending lighting data (DMX universes) over Ethernet. sACN (Streaming ACN) is also known as E1.31 (the ANSI standard number). It breaks the data into universes (512 channels per universe, each channel = 1 byte for one LED color intensity). Controllers like the Falcon F16 listen for sACN or Art-Net packets that contain intensity values for each channel4. For example, if you have 300 RGB LEDs on output1, that’s 900 channels (3 per LED) which might be spread across 2 universes (512 + 388). The Falcon knows which universe/channel corresponds to the first LED on each output based on your config. Art-Net is a similar concept from the lighting industry. DDP (Distributed Display Protocol) is another efficient one that both WLED and Falcon support; it’s more compact for large pixel data. If you use FPP, it hides most of this – you’ll configure outputs in FPP and it will either directly drive GPIO (for PiCap) or send E1.31 to the Falcon. If running without FPP, you’d configure Home Assistant or xLights to send E1.31 to the Falcon’s IP. For a small setup, you likely won’t touch these protocols directly except in configs, but it’s good to know: they are the reason a Falcon can accept data from a computer or Pi over standard Cat5 network cable and control lights with sub-millisecond timing.
xLights: This is sequencing software used to create choreographed light shows (with music or without). It’s a PC/Mac application where you layout your props (house outlines, trees, etc.) and apply effects on a timeline. If you plan to do a synced Christmas show, you will use xLights extensively. It outputs .fseq sequence files that FPP plays. xLights isn’t involved in live control or daily on/off (that’s HA’s job in your case), but it’s the creative tool for programmed shows. It’s free and community-supported.
FPP (Falcon Player) Modes: FPP can run in different modes – e.g. Standalone (a single FPP instance plays sequences and directly controls its outputs), Master/Remote (one master FPP syncs time/code with remote FPPs on other controllers for larger setups), etc. For you, a single Pi FPP in standalone is fine. The Falcon F16v4 has a mode where it can act as a remote FPP player itself (running sequences from SD) syncing to a master4. That’s more relevant if you had multiple controllers across a property. With one Pi and PiCap, you’re just standalone; with an F16 plus Pi, you might set the Pi as master and F16 as remote or just use bridge mode. These details you can explore if needed on Falcon forum – but this is far beyond the initial scope.
“Ray Wu” Connectors: In the community, you’ll see references to Ray Wu pigtails. Ray Wu is a seller who popularized a certain 3-pin waterproof connector for pixels. These connectors have a keyed threaded barrel and come in male/female pairs on pigtail leads. The standard wiring is usually red = V+, white/green = Data, blue/black = Ground (but always verify each cable’s color scheme!). Other connector systems exist (like xConnect, used by some US vendors, which is similar concept but not cross-compatible with Ray Wu). Since you’ve seen Ray Wu’s name, likely the strands you get will use those connectors. They are reliable and widely used. Just make sure to screw them tight and use the o-ring for waterproofing. It’s a good idea to apply dielectric grease inside to prevent corrosion over years. When ordering pixels or extensions, specify the same connector type so everything fits. Adapters exist if needed (for example, to go from Ray Wu to xConnect, etc., as sold on Wally’s Lights)3. But best to stick to one standard in your setup.
Mounting Terms: A few mounting-related terms: J-Channel (a type of house siding trim that some DIYers use to mount pixel strips by drilling holes), Boscoyo strips (a brand of plastic strip with evenly spaced holes for pixels – great for outlining windows/doors with pixel nodes), Permatrack/Invisilite (proprietary mounting channels for permanent installs)2. Also diffusers – if using strips in aluminum channel, the diffused cover helps blend the light for a smooth line effect. For pixels, some use covers or caps (like C7/C9 bulb covers to make them look like traditional bulbs – optional aesthetic upgrade). Since you plan a year-round installation, investing in good mounting will make it look clean and last longer. UV-resistant plastic or aluminum is recommended for outdoors so it doesn’t degrade in sun.
That covers the major terms and standards you asked about. To recap the recommendations: for a beginner-friendly start, the ESP32/WLED option is fantastic – you could be up and running quickly, enjoying effects and Home Assistant control with minimal fuss. Meanwhile, the Falcon controller option is there if you decide to expand into a full holiday light show or just prefer a centralized, wired setup. It’s not an all-or-nothing choice – you can even combine them (for example, use WLED for some garden lights and a Falcon PiCap for the roofline). Both will integrate with Home Assistant and can coexist.

Next Steps: If you want to dip your toes in gently, you might start with a single WLED controller and a 5 m strip to experiment. This will teach you about wiring, power injection, and software control in a low-stakes way. You can then reuse that strip/controller for a smaller section of your display (or elsewhere in the house) and move to the bigger installation once comfortable. On the other hand, if you’re confident and already leaning towards Falcon, you can proceed with the Pi + PiCap and set it up for your first 2–3 strips, knowing that this infrastructure can grow with your ambitions.
